# DungeonousDagrons
Simple tools for pen and paper RPGs.
Until the node server is up just use http-server (install from npm).

Use:
1) Install node on your machine.
2) Install NPM on your machine.
3) Install http-server using NPM.
3) Open the command prompt and navigate to the directory where you downloaded/extracted this project to.
e.g I extracted mine at C:\Users\[username]\stuff\DungeonousDagrons-master
4) Navigate to the project's directory which contains the index.html file.
4a) Run npm install at this point to get the node_mnodules.
5) In command prompt run http-server by typing in 'http-server' and hitting enter.
6) Using some browser navigate to the IP listed in the command prompt and have fun.

NOTE 3/29/2019: If you downloaded the zip, for some reason there is another directory called 'DungeonousDagrons-master' (looks like 
C:\Users\[username]\stuff\DungeonousDagrons-master\DungeonousDagrons-master)-- this is the directory you want to run http server from.
If you run it from the parent directory there is a bug which I can't figure out how to commit a change for....
